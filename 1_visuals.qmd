::: {.card .flow title="Attack Timing" expandable="false"}

Active attacks occur for a variety of reasons, sometimes they are planned 
and other times not. Here, we show the timing of active attacks from 2000 to 
`{r} years_max`, a critical element for premeditated attacks with the goal of 
maximizing casualties. As the plots demonstrate, some dimensions of time are 
more informative than others.  

**By Year**  
There appears to be more events in the last five years 
(mean = `{r} mean_last_5yr`) than the first five years 
(mean = `{r} mean_first_5yr`) or second five years 
(mean = `{r} mean_second_5yr`); however, this may be an artifact of media 
coverage. Attacks that occurred during the first part of this data collection 
period likely did not get the national coverage that they do now. Furthermore, 
technology and search engines have improved dramatically over the `{r} years` 
years of this data collection period.

**By Month**  
In contrast to the obvious upward trend in attacks across years, there appear 
to be only a modest trend related to months of the year. Active Attacks tend to 
peak during the warmer months of the year (e.g., April through August account 
for `{r} warm_months_pct`% of attacks), though this trend is not a strong one. 
The relationship with temperature is similar to trends observed for certain 
types of violent crime (e.g., aggravated assault, homicide) that also tend to 
peak during the warmest parts of the year.

**By Day of the Week**  
Active attacks share no observable association with day of the week. This can 
be seen by the flat distribution of attacks across the week. So while 
there may be trends by year and month, attacks appear to be nearly equally 
likely on any given day of the week.

**By Hour of the Day**  
Active attacks tend to cluster around midday. While attacks that begin at 
midday exactly are relatively infrequent (only `{r} midday_pct`% of attacks), 
the majority of attacks occur immediately before midday (8-11am hours account 
for `{r} late_morn_pct`% of attacks) or after midday (1-4pm hours account for 
`{r} early_aft_pct`% of attacks).

::: {.card .flow title="Attackers" expandable="false"}
Many in the media attempt to create a profile describing the “average” attacker. 
The data do not support a profile beyond sex and number of attackers. Attackers
were male `{r} male_pct`% of the time. Furthermore, the 
attacker commits the attack by him/herself `{r} solo_pct`% of the time. 
Beyond these characteristics, attackers are somewhat more varied. 

**Attacker Race/Ethnicity**  
The racial/ethnic makeup of attackers roughly mirrored that of the general 
population, though Caucasians were under-represented and African 
Americans were over-represented. Most attackers were either Caucasian 
(`{r} white_pct`%) or African American (`{r} black_pct`%). All other 
racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Latino, Asian, Middle Eastern) only accounted for 
around a quarter of attackers (`{r} other_pct`%). 

**Attacker Age**  
While the median age of attackers was `{r} age_median` years old, attackers 
ranged in age from `{r} age_min` to `{r} age_max`. Attackers in their twenties 
were the most plentiful group compared to any other decade of life. The 
age-trend of attackers adheres to the classic "age-crime curve" observed for 
nearly every crime type, peaking in late adolescence/early adulthood and 
steadily declining throughout the rest of the life course.

**Weapon Type**  
Active attacks can be carried out using any weapon though, in reality, only a 
very small minority of attacks (`{r} non_gun_pct`%) were carried out using 
weapons other than firearms (e.g., knife, vehicle). Among types of firearms, 
handguns made up a clear majority (`{r} pistol_pct`%), while rifles (e.g., 
AR15s) and shotguns were used in `{r} rifle_pct`% and `{r} shotgun_pct`% of the 
time, respectively.

::: {.card .flow title="Attack Location" expandable="false"}
Defining where an attack occurred can be difficult. For instance, on January 8, 
2011 a shooter attacked a meeting for U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords. 
This attack happened in the parking lot of a local Tucson grocery store. Had 
the attack happened in the store it would have been classified as a business 
event; however, since the attack occurred in the parking lot it is coded as an 
outdoor event. Bear these fine distinctions in mind when examining the 
visualizations in this section.

**Location Type**  
As seen here, the plurality of events happen at places of business 
(`{r} business_pct`%). Places of business include factories/warehouse, retail 
locations, and office space. Around a quarter of attacks 
(`{r} outdoors_pct`%) happened in public (outdoor) spaces. Schools were 
attacked `{r} school_n` times (`{r} school_pct`%). These events are aggregated 
and include attacks on all types of educational facilities, including K-12 and 
institutes of higher education. Lastly, `{r} other_n` attacks 
(`{r} other_pct`%) happened at "Other" locations (e.g., houses of worship).

**Relationship to Location**  
In a vast majority of attacks (`{r} norel_pct`% of all attacks), the 
attacker(s) had no prior association with the attack location. For attackers 
with some relationship to the location, former/current students 
(`{r} student_pct`%) and current/former employees (`{r} coworker_pct`%) were 
the most common relationship types, followed by indirect (e.g., the attacker's 
wife was associated with the location; (`{r} indirect_pct`%)) and "other" 
associations (`{r} other_rel_pct`%).

**Relationship by Location Type**  
When looking within location types, we find that most attackers had no 
relationship to the locations. Going beyond attackers with no relationship,  
we find some interesting patterns. Depsite making up only 
`{r} coworker_pct` of attackers generally, attackers of businesses were 
current/former employees `{r} business_coworker_pct`% of the time. A similar 
trend is observable in schools, though in this case, the vast majority of 
attackers were current/former students (`{r} school_student_pct`%). Only a 
small percentage of attacks (`{r} school_norel_pct`) on schools were 
perpetrated by an attacker with no relationship to the school.

**Time of Day by Location Type**  
When grouped by location type, the tendency of attacks to occur around midday 
is still observable, though it is modest. The most noticeable trend can be see 
with attacks at schools, where there is a strong tendency for attacks to 
occur during the morning hours prior to midday. Note: this plot shows the 
density of attacks *within* location types, meaning that the concentration of 
attacks is relative to other attacks within the same location type and *not* 
to concentrations displayed for other location types.

::: {.card .flow title="Victims" expandable="false"}
There were `{r} format_num(casualty_tot)` casualties from active attacks between 
2000 and `{r} years_max`. Of these, `{r} format_num(kill_tot)` people died. The
visualizations in this section examine these fatalities.

**Attacks vs. Fatalities by Year**  
Attacks and total fatalities have been increasing over the course of data 
collection (2000-`{r} years_max`). For specific years, however, there are 
noticeable spikes in the number of deaths. These spike often correspond to some 
of the more well-known attacks. For example:  

-   **2007**: The attack on Apr. 16th at Virginia Tech, Virginia, resulted in 
`{r} virginia_tech_total` deaths, accounting for 
`{r} virginia_tech_total_pct`% of all attacks that year.
-   **2009**: The attack on Nov. 5th at Fort Hood (now Fort Cavazos), Texas, resulted in 
`{r} fort_hood_total` deaths, accounting for `{r} fort_hood_total_pct`% of 
all attacks that year.
-   **2012**: The school shooting on Dec. 14th at Sandy Hook Elementary School, 
Connecticut, resulted in `{r} sandy_hook_total` deaths, accounting for 
`{r} sandy_hook_total_pct`% of all attacks that year.
-   **2017**: The attack on Oct. 1st in Las Vegas, Nevada, resulted in 
`{r} las_vegas_total` deaths, accounting for `{r} las_vegas_total_pct`% of 
all attacks that year.

Of note, while the number of active attacks did not decrease during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the lethality of attacks did decrease to less than half the 
number of any of the four years previous. In 2021, however, the number of 
attacks increased and the number of deaths returned to pre-pandemic levels.

**Fatalities per Attack** (Interactive)    
Most attacks (`{r} deaths_lt10_pct`%) resulted in fewer than 10 fatalities, with
`{r} deaths_0_pct`% of attacks resulting in no deaths at all. Hover over the 
points on this plot to get information about that specific attack.

**Fatalities per Weapon Type** (Interactive)  
While most attacks (`{r} pistol_pct`%) were committed using handguns, the only 
such attack that resulted in more than 20 fatalities occurred at Virginia Tech,
2007. Attacks using rifles accounted for all of the remaining attacks that 
surpassed 20 deaths. Hover over the points on this plot to get information 
about that specific attack.

Active attacks have been recorded in `{r} states_n` states and the District of
Columbia. States with no recorded attacks include `{r} states_miss`. While most
states have at least some number of attacks, the number of attacks (and 
fatalities) tend to cluster geographically. The visualizations in this section
show that geographic dimension.

**Attacks & Fatalities by State** (Interactive)  
The number of active attacks in a state strongly corresponds to the number of

It is the mission of the Research Ring at ALERRT to make the Active Attack 
Data as freely accessible as possible. Please feel free to explore the raw 
data in the window to the right or download as a *.csv* file using the 
download button below.  

The dataset is organized so that each row corresponds to a unique active 
attack. This means that some variables, like attacker characteristics, need 
some special handling. Because some events involved multiple attackers, 
variables like age, race/ethnicity, and sex, are given a special suffix 
(e.g., _1, _2, _3) that correspond to specific attackers. For an attack with 
only one shooter, the demographic variables ending in _2 and _3 will contain 
missing values. The suffixes were assigned randomly and should not be taken as 
an indication that individuals described by variables ending in _1 were somehow 
more central to the attack than the other people involved.
