## Welcome!

This is the Active Attack Data Explorer, a website hosted by the Research Ring of the ALERRT Center at Texas State University, located in San Marcos, Texas.

## History of the Active Attack Project

This website hosts the overall data for the 567 active attacks that occurred between 2000-2023. You may request additional information or graphics under the Requests page. Lastly, we have dedicated a Remembrance page in memory of those lost over the last 24 years. 

## Definitions

The definition we use to vet potential active attacks is: An active attack occurs when an individual or individuals is actively killing or attempting to kill multiple unrelated people in a public space. The key component of the definition is the word "Actively". For an event to be an active attack there must be an active component. This requirement removes cases where law enforcement isn't aware the attack is happening. A good example of this is a family annihilation. In many of these events, the attacker kills his/her family in their private home. Law enforcement isn't made aware of the attack until well after it is over and is unable to intervene to save lives. During an active attack, first responders generally are made aware of the attack while it is still ongoing. As you'll see in the data, half of the time the event is over before law enforcement makes it to the scene because the attacker is stopped by civilians or stops himself (i.e., commits suicide or flees the location). 

Another important feature is that active attacks are not limited to attacks carried out with a firearm. Instead, active attacks include events where a firearm, knife, or even vehicle is used as the primary weapon. Any weapon can be used in an active attack as long as the primary concern is an attempt to kill as many people as possible. 

## Website Guide

Below are several plots that help illustrate the characteristics of active attacks included in the full Active Attack dataset. These visualization were created using the version of the dataset that is available for download on the [Download the Data](#download) page. We selected specific aspects of Active Attacks that we believe will help inform the public and law enforcement about the nature of active attacks. While these images are static, the [Dataviz Builder](#dataviz) page allows users to create their own graphics using aspects of the dataset that are of most interest to them.
