## History of the Active Attack Project

ALERRT started collecting data from active shooter events in 2010 in an effort 
to better understand how the attacks unfold and to inform ALERRT’s curriculum. 
This original dataset was focused on events where the attacker used a firearm. 
Around 2018, we expanded the definition to include attacks where any weapon was 
used in an attempt to commit mass murder. We started referring to this expanded 
data as the Active Attack data.  

ALERRT’s research ring partnered with the FBI to form an Active Shooter Working 
Group in 2013. Since then, we have assisted with the FBI’s annual reporting of 
active shooter events. The Active Attack Dataset includes all the FBI firearm 
attacks plus additional non-firearm attacks found by ALERRT’s research team. 

## Definitions

The definition we use to vet potential active attacks is the following: **an active attack occurs when an individual or individuals is actively killing or attempting to kill multiple unrelated people in a public space**. The key component of the definition is the word "*actively*". For an event to be an active attack there must be an active component. This requirement removes cases where law enforcement is not aware the attack is happening. A good example of this is a family annihilation. In many of these events, the attacker kills his/her family in their private home. Law enforcement is not made aware of the attack until well after it is over and is unable to intervene to save lives. During an active attack, first responders generally are made aware of the attack while it is still ongoing. As you will see in the data, half of the time the event is over before law enforcement makes it to the scene because the attacker is stopped by civilians or stops himself (e.g., flees the scene or commits suicide).

Another important feature is that active attacks are not limited to attacks carried out with a firearm. Instead, active attacks include events where a firearm, knife, or even vehicle is used as the primary weapon. Any weapon can be used in an active attack as long as the primary concern is an attempt to kill as many people as possible.

## Website Guide

There are several different pages on this website that may be of interest.  

#### Visualizing Active Attacks
The [Visualizing Active Attacks](./1_visuals.qmd) page presents many 
visualizations created by our team to show different aspects of the data. All 
visualization are downloadable as *.png*/*.gif*/*.mp4* files. There
are several sub-pages that organize these visualizations:

* [By The Numbers](./1_visuals.qmd#by-the-numbers): Counts and
percentages of event characteristics (e.g., date/time, location type/
relationship), shooter characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, number of 
shooters, number of weapons), and fatalities. 

* [Across The USA](./1_visuals.qmd#across-the-usa): Geographic 
distribution of attacks across the USA. This page includes plots as well as 
maps.

* [Download The Data](./1_visuals.html#download-the-data): This page 
allows users to view the data underlying all of the visualizations. In 
addition to viewing the data, users can download the data directly as a *.csv*
file.

#### Remembrance
The [Remembrance](./2_victims.qmd) page catalogs all victims who died because 
of the attacks included in the Active Attack dataset.
