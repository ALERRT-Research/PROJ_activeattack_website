    "text": "Don’t Name Them\nAt ALERRT, it is our policy to refrain from naming the person or people responsible for active attacks. Research has shown that many attacks are the result of fame-seeking behavior by the shooters. By refusing to name them, we aim to remove fame and notoriety as possible motivators of future attacks. Below are listed several resources and research papers examining the effect of naming and the movement to deprive would-be shooters of any additional motivation."

    "text": "Definitions\nThe definition we use to vet potential active attacks is the following: an active attack occurs when an individual or individuals is actively killing or attempting to kill multiple unrelated people in a public space. The key component of the definition is the word “actively”. For an event to be an active attack there must be an active component. This requirement removes cases where law enforcement is not aware the attack is happening. A good example of this is a family annihilation. In many of these events, the attacker kills his/her family in their private home. Law enforcement is not made aware of the attack until well after it is over and is unable to intervene to save lives. During an active attack, first responders generally are made aware of the attack while it is still ongoing. As you will see in the data, half of the time the event is over before law enforcement makes it to the scene because the attacker is stopped by civilians or stops himself (e.g., flees the scene or commits suicide).\nAnother important feature is that active attacks are not limited to attacks carried out with a firearm. Instead, active attacks include events where a firearm, knife, or even vehicle is used as the primary weapon. Any weapon can be used in an active attack as long as the primary concern is an attempt to kill as many people as possible."

This page includes plots as well as maps.\nDownload The Data: This page allows users to view the data underlying all of the visualizations. In addition to viewing the data, users can download the data directly as a .csv file.\n\nAll visualization are downloadable as .png images.\n\n\nRemembrance\nThe Remembrance page catalogs all victims who died because of the attacks included in the Active Attack dataset."
