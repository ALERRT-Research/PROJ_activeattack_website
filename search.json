The purpose of this website is to make that data set more accessible to the general public, as well as the entire first responder community. Using the data, we have developed many visualizations that communicate import aspects of the data in the hopes that we can better understand these unfortunate events and improve in our efforts to prevent them in the future.\nAll of the media on this website is easily downloadable and we encourage their use. Please take some time to learn more about the history and definitions of the Active Attack Data in the sections that follow. At the bottom of this page, you will also find a guide that lists the contents of the website for easy navigation."

    "text": "History\nALERRT started collecting data from active shooter events in 2010 in an effort to better understand how the attacks unfold and to inform ALERRT’s curriculum. This original data set was focused on events where the attacker used a firearm. Around 2018, we expanded the definition to include attacks where any weapon was used in an attempt to commit mass murder. We started referring to this expanded data as the Active Attack data.\nALERRT’s research ring partnered with the FBI to form an Active Shooter Working Group in 2013. Since then, we have assisted with the FBI’s annual reporting of active shooter events. The Active Attack Data includes all the FBI firearm attacks plus additional non-firearm attacks found by ALERRT’s research team."

    "section": "Definitions",
    "text": "Definitions\nThe definition we use to vet potential active attacks is the following: an active attack occurs when an individual or individuals is actively killing or attempting to kill multiple unrelated people in a public space. The key component of the definition is the word “actively”. For an event to be an active attack there must be an active component. This requirement removes cases where law enforcement is not aware the attack is happening. A good example of this is a family annihilation. In many of these events, the attacker kills his/her family in their private home. Law enforcement is not made aware of the attack until well after it is over and is unable to intervene to save lives. During an active attack, first responders generally are made aware of the attack while it is still ongoing. As you will see in the data, half of the time the event is over before law enforcement makes it to the scene because the attacker is stopped by civilians or stops himself (e.g., flees the scene or commits suicide).\nAnother important feature is that active attacks are not limited to attacks carried out with a firearm. Instead, active attacks include events where a firearm, knife, or even vehicle is used as the primary weapon. Any weapon can be used in an active attack as long as the primary concern is an attempt to kill as many people as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor an helpful discussion of the similarities and differences between “active attack” and other terms commonly mis-used in the media, please refer to this 2022 paper by Sandel & Martaindale (Journal of Mass Violence Research):\n\nWhat Are We Talking About? Definitional Confusion Within Active and Mass Shooting Research"

All visualization are downloadable as .png/.gif/.mp4 files. There are several sub-pages that organize these visualizations:\n\nTiming: Gives a breakdown of active attacks across different time scales, including years, month of year, day of week, and hour of day.\nAttackers: Examines the characteristics of the attackers responsible for active attacks including race/ethnicity, age, and weapons used.\nLocations: Examines topics like the location type of attack location, relationship of the attack to the locations, and the time of attacks across location types.\nFatalities: Examines the lethality of specific active attacks, as well as the change in fatalities vs attacks across years.\nAcross the USA: Geographic distribution of attacks and fatalities across the USA, as well as the accumulation of attacks across years.\nDownload the Data: This page allows users to view the data underlying all of the visualizations. In addition to viewing the data, users can download the data directly as a .csv file.\n\n\n\nRemembrance\nThe Remembrance page catalogs all victims who died because of the attacks included in the Active Attack dataset.\n\n\nContact\nThe Contact page provides contact information for the members of the Research Ring at the ALERRT Center."

Research has shown that many attacks are the result of fame-seeking behavior by the attackers. By refusing to name them, we aim to remove fame and notoriety as possible motivators of future attacks. ALERRT hosts a website, DontNameThem.org, that provides more information and resources about the “Don’t Name Them” movement."
