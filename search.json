    "text": "Definitions\nThe definition we use to vet potential active attacks is: An active attack occurs when an individual or individuals is actively killing or attempting to kill multiple unrelated people in a public space. The key component of the definition is the word “Actively”. For an event to be an active attack there must be an active component. This requirement removes cases where law enforcement isn’t aware the attack is happening. A good example of this is a family annihilation. In many of these events, the attacker kills his/her family in their private home. Law enforcement isn’t made aware of the attack until well after it is over and is unable to intervene to save lives. During an active attack, first responders generally are made aware of the attack while it is still ongoing. As you’ll see in the data, half of the time the event is over before law enforcement makes it to the scene because the attacker is stopped by civilians or stops himself (i.e., commits suicide or flees the location).\nAnother important feature is that active attacks are not limited to attacks carried out with a firearm. Instead, active attacks include events where a firearm, knife, or even vehicle is used as the primary weapon. Any weapon can be used in an active attack as long as the primary concern is an attempt to kill as many people as possible."

These visualization were created using the version of the dataset that is available for download on the Download the Data page. We selected specific aspects of Active Attacks that we believe will help inform the public and law enforcement about the nature of active attacks. While these images are static, the Dataviz Builder page allows users to create their own graphics using aspects of the dataset that are of most interest to them."
