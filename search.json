    "text": "The Active Attack Data is a dataset maintained by the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center at Texas State University. The purpose of this website is to make that dataset more accessible to the general public, as well as to the entire first responder community. Using the data, we have developed many visualizations that communicate important aspects of the dataset in the hopes that we may better understand these unfortunate events and improve our efforts to prevent them in the future.\nAll of the media on this website are easily downloadable, and we encourage their use. Please take some time to learn more about the history and definitions of the Active Attack Data in the sections that follow. At the bottom of this page, you will also find a guide listing the website’s contents for easy navigation."

    "text": "History\nALERRT started collecting data from active shooter events in 2010 to better understand how these attacks unfold and to inform ALERRT’s curriculum. This original dataset focused on events where the attacker used a firearm. Around 2018, we expanded the definition to include attacks involving any weapon used in an attempt to commit mass murder. We started referring to this expanded data as the Active Attack Data.\nALERRT’s research ring partnered with the FBI in 2013 to form an Active Shooter Working Group. Since then, we have assisted with the FBI’s annual reporting of active shooter events. The Active Attack Data includes all the FBI-documented firearm attacks, plus additional non-firearm attacks identified by ALERRT’s research team."

    "section": "Definitions",
    "text": "Definitions\nWe define an active attack as follows: an active attack occurs when an individual or individuals is actively killing or attempting to kill multiple unrelated people in a public space. The key component of this definition is the word actively. For an event to qualify as an active attack, it must involve an active component. This requirement excludes cases where law enforcement is unaware that the attack is happening.\nA good example is a family annihilation. In many such events, the attacker kills their family in a private home. Law enforcement often learns of these attacks only after they’ve ended, too late to intervene and save lives. By contrast, first responders are typically alerted to an active attack while it is ongoing. As you will see in the data, half the time, the event ends before law enforcement arrives on the scene because the attacker is stopped by civilians or stops themselves (e.g., flees the scene or commits suicide).\nActive attacks are not limited to those carried out with firearms. Instead, active attacks encompass events where a firearm, knife, or even a vehicle serves as the primary weapon. Any weapon can be used in an active attack as long as the intent is to kill as many people as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor a helpful discussion of the similarities and differences between “active attack” and other terms commonly misused in the media, please refer to this 2022 paper by Sandel & Martaindale (Journal of Mass Violence Research):\n\nWhat Are We Talking About? Definitional Confusion Within Active and Mass Shooting Research"

Research has shown that many attacks are the result of fame-seeking behavior by the attackers. By refusing to name them, we aim to remove fame and notoriety as possible motivators of future attacks. ALERRT hosts a website, DontNameThem.org, that provides more information and resources about the “Don’t Name Them” movement."
