## Welcome!

This repository contains the source code for the Active Attack Data Explorer
website, hosted by the Research Ring at the ALERRT Center at Texas State 
University.  

Currently, the website hosts a number of visualizations, gifs, and videos (all
downloadable) that showcase various aspects of the Active Attack Data. Due
a number of technical limitations, this repository does not contain the code 
for creating these visualizations, only hosting them on the website. If you are 
interested in the code itself, please reach out to Peter Tanksley 
(tanksley@alerrt.org).  

If you experience any issues with the website or notice any errors, please let
contact us at the above email.
